## Sample size calculation for medical and allied health students
I have made five Shinyapps to do the sample size calculation for some basic study designs.  Each of these apps load with some default values but all these values can be changed very easily in an interactive manner.  You can use the values appropriate for your particular sample size calculation requirement.

Suggestions welcome but I cannot increase the number of apps to more than five - the limit for Shinyapps free paln!
